     	You dont deserve a paragraph. You deserve a thousand books witten about how amazing you are. You're beautiful and when u smile, its the prettiest thing ive ever seen. I know ive never really made it clear how much i like you, but ive been afraid you wont feel the same. Sometimes i think you're too beautiful for me. I miss you when we dont see eachother even though we're not even together. I thought id better let you know how i feel. Its pointless keeping these feelings to myself. You deserve to know that u mean the world to someone. 

        Im a girl an a guy sent me something like this once. He wasnt my type of boy, i hardly knew him and he wasnt an amazingly good looking boy and i didnt love him at all, but his words charmed me lots and after a few days of him telling me nice things every minute i was about to fall for him, but then he went too far and stuff so we stoppe talking. So make sure u keep it sweet and not complicated
